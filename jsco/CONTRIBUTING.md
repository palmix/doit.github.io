# Contributing

Contributings are always welcome, nothing specific. Since there are no unit or e2e tests, you need to provide a link to working example of a bugfix or a feature. You can use gh-pages branch when you make pull request.

## How to run and make changes

Prerequirements: NodeJS 7+, NPM 4+.

Install needed deps via ``npm install`` (it also compiles browser version of UglifyJS).

To run development server you need to run ``npm run develop`` and open [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100).

To compile the app (without dev server stuff) run ``npm run bundle``.
